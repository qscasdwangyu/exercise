// 2-3 Q2. You can put an array as element inside 
// another array. This is known as nested array, and 
// can represent two dimensional arrays, e.g. a matrix.
// Given a 2D matrix in the variable `mat`, write a
// JavaScript program to find its inverse. 
// See https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/matrices-maths.html 
// to review the mathematics of inverse of 2x2 matrix.

let mat = [ 
  [ 1, 0],
  [-1, 3]
];
